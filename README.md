# Rails App Templates

Having a template that developers can use when generating a service will save some time and remove some of the incongruencies between development environments. Once this template is complete, a developer will be able to type

`$ rails new <project_name> -m template.rb`

and then go straight into development. Things like guard will work immediately, without any need to set them up. Just like it should be.
